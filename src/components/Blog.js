You used to be able to break into Hoover Tower via Steam Tunnels. the dish is great to watch sunrises. green library has a bunch of secluded desks on the upper floor that look out over the campus.the dish is great to watch sunrises. green library has a bunch of secluded desks on the upper floor that look out over the campus. the math building has super cool posters that advertise events. if you go around Huang there is a nice place to chill/ study in the shade and if you go straight thru the building and in to the next, there’s a bunch of abandoned offices and stuff to hang out in!</p>

                                            <p>Earth systems student Mercedes Blancaflor received the 2021 Truman scholarship. Blancaflor was nationally recognized for her leadership and commitment to impacting climate change. 
                                                Led by atmospheric scientist Aditi Sheshadri, the research aims to leverage Loon balloon data, high-resolution simulations, and data-informed methods to understand the impact of gravity waves on climate and improve their representation in climate models.
                                                Salvador investigated the diversity and symbiotic relationships of nitrogen-fixing microorganisms – which are involved with critical biogeochemical cycles – within marine sediments and deep-sea methane seeps.

                                    <p class="blog-text">Inspiration hits like a ton of bricks. You never know when it will come or what will bring it on. Inspiration can take you on an impossible journey that can lead to riches or enlightenment. It also can end up as the first 10 pages of a never-to-be-finished novel or just a sketch in a notebook, but it still deserves to be pursued.

                                        Inspiration that leads nowhere still has value. Peace of mind is hard to come by these days, the wouldas, couldas, and shouldas that might cause you sleepless nights will be kept at bay.

Each of these sites demonstrates technical expertise, is relatively easy to comprehend, publishes content consistently, and has stood the test of time.

                                        During this process, I used the same approach for analyzing and comparing common qualities (or deficiencies) in each blog.
                                        
                                        I looked at the depth of each blog’s technical content and the usefulness of that content. </p>

                                    <p class="blog-text">One of the best kept secrets in Photoshop is Quick masks. It’s funny because this tool is so important that Adobe included it on the bottom of the tool bar. So why don’t more people use them, or even know about them? My theory is, Quick Masks have been around forever and many of us have used them for years. Because they have been around so long (like many great tools in Photoshop) there hasn’t been an emphasis on them, like the newer tools like object selection.</p>
